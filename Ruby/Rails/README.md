### About this Demo

This demo/tutorial is a slightly modified version of the [Rails Getting Started tutorial](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html). It allows you to create a stripped down Ruby on Rails clone of the system we use to manage charts on [our own gallery](http://www.zingchart.com/gallery/). Feel free to use it for managing your own charts or as a jumping off point to build something even cooler!
